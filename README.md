repository.chintogtokh.xbmc
===========================

A repository of my XBMC addons

## plugin.video.allsp

For watching South Park episodes hosted via allsp. The video quality is low, but there's no buffering and it beats the ad infested once-mighty SPS and related addons. A few (2?) episodes are hosted on movshare, and the urlresolver script to obtain raw video links is broken, so theses aren't watchable on XBMC for now.

Code initially inspired by [Voinage's now-deprecated Southpark plugin](https://code.google.com/p/voinage-xbmc-plugins/downloads/detail?name=Southpark.rar&can=4&q=), the params function is taken from there.

## plugin.video.mongoltv

For watching Mongolian TV channels: MNB 1&2, UBS 1&2&3, EduTV, OllooTV, TV5 using rtmp streams (found from their websites and flash streams). You can download the .zip file and install to XBMC using the "Install from zip file" submenu.
